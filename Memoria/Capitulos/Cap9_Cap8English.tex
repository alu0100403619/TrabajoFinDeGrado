	\section{Future lines}
		Use cases that have not been contemplated when creating the application will be contemplated. Profiles as parents with children in different schools, teachers working in more than one center or users with different profiles on the same center, for example, a school teacher in the school that your child attends.
	
	\section{Conclusions}
		The realization of this project will apply the expertise gained during the years of study allowing real assimilation of the necessary skills and acquire new knowledge.
		This experience discloses the level of involvement that involves creating a fully functional application in a real environment. The analysis of other similar applications can realize the state of the market for the type of application built.
