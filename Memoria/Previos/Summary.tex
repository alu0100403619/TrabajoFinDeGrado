		The overall objective of this project has been to create an \textit{Android} application using new technologies and the Internet storage services, commonly known as cloud. It was intended to establish a system of school communication for parents, teachers and students to be interconnected.
		
		\bigskip
		With the use of these technologies the number of school problems has increased. It's not just those originating inside the classrooms and that teachers can control, but also they have spread to affect students in other areas.
		
		\bigskip
		On this basis, and with the knowledge acquired throughout studies in the Degree in Computer Engineering from the University of La Laguna, we have designed an application that can assist to solve this problems.
		
		\bigskip
		For this we used the integrated development environment, AndroidStudio, along with Firebase, a cloud services provider.
		
		\bigskip
		{\bf Keywords:} Android applications, mobile devices, schools, education, communication tools.
